# ROT

ROT is one the easiest ciphering algorithms out there. It was originally made by Julius Caesar to write is personal messages. It works by simply shifting letters in alphabet by certain amount of characters. For example word "Hi" in ROT-2 would be "Jk"

## Purpose

I created this package just to see how easy it is to publish a `Golang` package.
